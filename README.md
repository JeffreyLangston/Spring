SPrinG App Privacy Policy
Last updated: June 1, 2022
Who is responsible for this app?
Your privacy is important to us. The SPrinG app (“App”) is owned by Unity Health Toronto
and led by Dr. Flora Matheson at the MAP Centre for Urban Health Solutions at St. Michael’s
Hospital, Unity Health Toronto.
This Privacy Policy (“Privacy Policy”) describes the types of information we may collect
from you or that you may provide when you use of our App and our practices for collecting, using,
maintaining, protecting, and disclosing that information. By accessing or using the App, you
accept the practices and policies outlined in this Privacy Policy and you hereby consent that we
will collect, use, and disclose your information as set forth in this Privacy Policy. If any term in
this Privacy Policy is unacceptable to you, your choice is to delete the App and no longer
participate in the research.
We reserve the right to change this Privacy Policy at any time. It is our policy to post any
changes we make to our Privacy Policy posted on this page. The date this Privacy Policy was last
revised is identified at the top of the page. You are responsible for periodically monitoring and
reviewing any updates to the Privacy Policy. Your continued use of our App after such
amendments will be deemed your acknowledgment of these changes to this Privacy Policy.
Information we collect about you and how we collect it
We will collect your email in the registration process to create an account so App users
can recover their account information (e.g., forgot password, loss of phone or deletion of app
and then return to use).
Within the App we collect data that each user directly enters into the App and aggregate
data on App usage patterns through Google Analytics (see below).
Participant Entered Data (Research Data)
After you agree to participate in the research study, you will be asked to complete a brief
survey that includes questions about your age, sex/gender, education, race/ethnicity, income,
housing status, country of origin, and if applicable to you, immigration/length of residence in
Canada. You will also be asked to complete the Problem Gambling Severity Index (PGSI), which
helps you assess the severity of your gambling problems.
With the Gambling Symptom Assessment Scale (G-SAS) embedded in the App, you can
record your gambling symptoms. This is a weekly tracking process that allows you to see changes
in symptoms over time.

The urge and gambling journals will help you to identify the types of situations in which
you tend to experience urges and gamble. The journals allow you to track your urge and gambling
experiences, including when they occur, your thoughts and feelings, the type of game and
location, wins/losses, whether you were alone or with others, and whether alcohol or drug use
was involved.
Google Analytics Data
Google Analytics collects aggregated App usage data, for example, how often you open
the App, if you delete the App, and how long you engage with the App. These data will allow the
research team to assess when and how participants use the App.
We limit what we collect and use
You will be assigned a unique and anonymous participant ID which allows our research
team to know that the information we collect all comes from the same participant. Our study
team will not attempt to identify you. This research is bound by our ethics certificate and
approval by Unity Health Toronto.
We will not collect your name. We will save your email address on secure a Unity Health
Toronto server for purposes of managing your account, account creation, account recovery,
responding to your emails or as otherwise permitted here. We will not use your email address
for any marketing or advertising purposes and will not share your email address with any thirdparties except those necessary to manage the account or as provided in this policy. Be aware that
your email may contain personal identifiers (e.g., your name, your year of birth) which may
inadvertently identify you. The contents of the email you send may also inadvertently identify
you (e.g., signature line; auto responses); in such instances, this information will be kept
confidential.
How we collect, use, store and protect your information
When you download the App, you will be asked for your email address and password to
create your account. To use the App after creating your account, you will receive and click on a
confirmation email that identifies you as the account owner.
If you forget your password and need to reset it, you will also receive a confirmation email
sent to your email address. Since emails are not as secure as regular mail or phone calls, anyone
who sees these emails could know that you are taking part in this research. Emails may be read
or saved by your internet or phone provider. Copies of an email may continue to exist even after
efforts to delete the email have been made. There is also a chance with unencrypted email that
it could be intercepted or manipulated.
The research data you provide in the App will be stored in a de-identified database. As
noted above, you will be assigned a unique participant ID that will be used in all study activities
to keep you anonymous. All information in the App (e.g. your name/username, email, journal
entries, insights) will be kept on secure servers in Canada. Your data will also be kept on the

servers for use by our researchers until 7 years after the end of the study, which is usual research
practice.
Disclosure of your information
Google Analytics
The SPrinG App also uses Google Analytics to help us identify how people are using App
so that we can continue to improve it over time. Google Analytics may track your IP address but
does not give our research team access to any information that can identify you.
Your rights to your research data
You will have access to some of your data during your study participation period. The
research consent form has all the details about how this research is conducted and how your
information is used for our research. To use the SPrinG App, you will need to have read and
consented to the research consent form. As long as your SPrinG App account is active (that is,
you do not delete your account), you will have access to some of your research data.
As described above, our researchers will have access to the data linked to your unique
and anonymous participant ID to know that the information comes from the same participant.
You are free to stop your participation in this research at any time. To stop participating
in the study, simply delete your SPRinG account or tap the button to withdraw from the study
(and lose access to the App). No data will be collected from you any longer, however, any data
collected about you up to that time will still be used in research related activities approved by
Unity Health Toronto’s Research Ethics Board (REB).
